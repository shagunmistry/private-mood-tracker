A simple, private mood tracker that keeps your data local. No accounts, no cloud, no tracking.



## Why?

I wanted to track my mood patterns without giving my emotional data to some company. Everything stays on your device - it never leaves.
It is also a PWA - Progressive Web App so if the user accesses it from their phone, they can "download" it without using the App Store and it will behave like an App, still keeping everything localized and private.

## Features

- **Track your mood** - Quick entry with notes
- **See patterns** - Charts showing trends over time
- **Export your data** - JSON export/import for backups
- **Works offline** - Install as a PWA on any device
- **Private** - All data stored locally in your browser
