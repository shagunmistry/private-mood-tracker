# Mood Diary

A simple, private mood tracker that keeps your data local. No accounts, no cloud, no tracking.

## Why?

I wanted to track my mood patterns without giving my emotional data to some company. Everything stays on your device - it never leaves.

## Features

- **Track your mood** - Quick entry with notes
- **See patterns** - Charts showing trends over time
- **Export your data** - JSON export/import for backups
- **Works offline** - Install as a PWA on any device
- **Private** - All data stored locally in your browser

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser.

## Tech

Built with Next.js, Chart.js, and Tailwind. Uses localStorage for data persistence.
